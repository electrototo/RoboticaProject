<h1>Robotic Claw</h1>
<p>First of all, this is my first time using git, so maybe the progress will be a little slow, but I'm looking forward on how to use git.</p>
<p>These are the files that I used in my school project, I used an arduino to control the claw, and send information to the raspberry pi.</p>
<p>I used the raspberry pi as a web server, the arduino sends information to the raspberry via serial, and then a small script I made with the raspberry interprets the data and sends it to a webpage that with javascript graphs it.</p>
